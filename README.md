FAQ Chatbot for Airbnb Hosts

The following chatbot has been created using Python 3

Please install the following python libraries to run the code:
pandas, pickle, joblib, nltk, sklearn

The code has been implemented into Airbnb messages using an API.
The model can be used via the terminal.

Please download the following files into the same folder, and run 'terminalchatbot.py'
After executing the code, you will be prompted to input a question to the Airbnb Host.
Frequently asked questions will be answered with a surprisingly good result, less common questions may not.

I have shared the sample of the cleaned training data to show how this model was created.
